## 📌 Problem Statement

> *"What key customer behavioural and financial factors influence churn in a banking system, and how can high-risk customers be identified early enough for effective retention intervention?"*

Customer churn is a major concern in the banking sector as it directly impacts revenue and long-term customer value. Banks lose substantial income when customers close accounts and switch to competitors — and the cost of acquiring a replacement customer far exceeds that of retaining an existing one.

This project addresses the challenge of **identifying the key behavioural and financial factors that drive churn**, enabling early intervention before customers leave.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Identify the primary drivers of customer churn through structured exploratory analysis.
2. Segment customers by risk level to prioritize retention resources.
3. Analyze the financial behavior patterns of churned vs. retained customers.
4. Build interactive Tableau dashboards that enable non-technical stakeholders to explore churn trends dynamically.

---

## 💡 Solution

The project delivered an end-to-end descriptive and diagnostic analytics pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion & ETL** — A customer-level banking dataset of ~28,000 records was sourced, cleaned, and preprocessed using Python.
2. **KPI Engineering** — Derived KPIs including Churn Rate, Active Rate, Average Balance, and Balance Change were computed from raw fields.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Patterns across activity status, tenure, balance trends, and risk segments were uncovered through structured visual and statistical analysis.
4. **Statistical Validation** — Hypothesis testing (chi-square), correlation analysis (point-biserial), distribution analysis, and anomaly detection were applied to validate findings.
5. **Interactive Dashboards** — Three Tableau dashboards translate analytical findings into accessible, decision-ready tools for non-technical stakeholders.

### 🔑 Key Insights

- 🔴 **Inactive customers** churn at rates significantly above the overall average — inactivity is the single most reliable leading indicator of churn.
- 🟠 **New customers (0–2 year tenure)** have the highest churn probability; the first two years are the critical retention window.
- 🟡 **Declining account balances** reliably precede customer churn — balance trajectory is an actionable early-warning signal.
- 🔵 **High-risk segment customers** exhibit disproportionately higher churn rates; risk classification is a valid targeting criterion for retention investment.
- 🟢 Customers with **both inactive status and low balance** represent a concentrated, immediately actionable churn-risk cluster.

### ✅ Key Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Estimated Churn Reduction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deploy early engagement campaigns for new customers (0–2 yr) with 30/60/90-day onboarding touchpoints | 10–20% of early-stage churn |
| 2 | Implement automated balance-decline alerts (>20% drop over 60 days) for proactive outreach | 5–15% of balance-driven churn |
| 3 | Launch reactivation programs for customers inactive for 60+ days | 8–15% reactivation rate |
| 4 | Develop personalized retention plans for high-risk segments | 15–25% of high-risk churn |
| 5 | Create occupation-specific financial products to reduce financial stress-driven exits | 5–10% in targeted segments |

## 📊 Tableau Dashboards

Three interactive dashboards were designed, each serving a distinct business question:

| Dashboard | Business Question | Key Visualizations |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Behavior Analysis** | *Why are customers churning?* | Activity vs. Churn, Tenure vs. Churn (cohort), Balance Decline Analysis |
| **2. Customer Segmentation** | *Who is at risk?* | Risk Segmentation Breakdown, Age Group Heatmap, Occupation Breakdown |
| **3. Customer Value & Balance** | *What is the financial impact?* | Balance Distribution, Balance Change Analysis, Avg Balance by Segment |

### Cleaning Steps Applied

- Churn labels standardised to binary integer format (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)
- Activity Status values normalised to consistent categorical encoding (Active / Inactive)
- Date fields converted to datetime format for tenure computation
- Categorical columns stripped of whitespace and converted to title case
- Missing values imputed using **median** (numeric) or **mode** (categorical) strategies
- Rows with missing churn labels were excluded from analysis to preserve integrity
- Numeric fields (Balance, Age, Tenure) assessed via **IQR-based outlier detection** and capped at 1st/99th percentiles (winsorization)

### Feature Engineering

| Derived Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Churn Rate** | Proportion of churned customers within each segment or cohort |
| **Activity Status Flag** | Derived binary field used for segmentation analysis |
| **Balance Difference** | Delta between opening and closing balance — proxy for financial trajectory |
| **Tenure Band** | Customers grouped into cohorts: 0–2 yrs, 3–5 yrs, 6–10 yrs, 10+ yrs |
